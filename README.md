# digital-ai-asset-management

## Vision Statement
The goal of this project is to replicate a use case of Entefy's MimiVision technology to digital asset management. https://www.entefy.com/customer-case-studies/#videointelligence

## Problem
As per Entefy, the process of searching through digital assets can be quite limited with the only options for search being filenames, dates, and other metadata. A more advanced search engine requires the tagging of people, scenes, objects, and other digital assets. Doing so manually is not only expensive, but highly error-prone. AI, in theory, should offer a way to automate the process of tagging and organizing the assets, making it easier to add a search element.

## Project Structure

The project is broken down into several mini-projects, each representing a milestone.
  * Object Detection
  * Object Tracking
  * Scene Detection
  * Logo and Face Recognition
  * Content Search & Retrieval
